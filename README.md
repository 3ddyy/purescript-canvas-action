# purescript-canvas-action

## Documentation

This is a package that introduces a monad for working with the HTML5 canvas
without having to pass a `Context2D` argument to every function that needs it.
It also has free monads for representing canvas transformations and paths in a
pure manner. These can later be run in the `CanvasActionM` monad. More info
in the respective modules.
